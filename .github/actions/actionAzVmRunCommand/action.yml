name: "AzVmRunCommand"
description: "This action uses az vm run-command in order to execute a command in the target VM, show the result and fail the build if the last command didn't execute properly."
  # Requires being logged into azure through the azure login action and setting the environment variables $rgName and $vmName 
  # with the names of the resource group and the vm we are targeting respectively 
  # WARNING: This action ONLY checks the exit code of the last command. If your script input is made of multiple commands, 
  # make sure that a failure early results in the last command failing or not executing, otherwise it could mask errors. 
  # Some options to do this include using [set -euo pipeline] or equivalents, or using the && operator to connect console commands
  # WARNING: This action hasn't been tested with script files.
